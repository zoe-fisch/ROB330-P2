# mbot_ros2_ws
> mbot - ROS2 Jazzy - Ubuntu 24.04

## To get started
### Clone the repository
This repository should be the `src` folder of the ROS2 workspace. So first we create the workspace `mbot_ws`. Then clone this repo as `src`.
```bash
mkdir mbot_ws
cd mbot_ws
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mbot-project/mbot_ros2_ws.git src
```
**OR** if you are using `gh`:
```bash
mkdir mbot_ws
cd mbot_ws
gh repo clone mbot-project/mbot_ros2_ws src
cd src
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then source the setup file:
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export ROS_AUTOMATIC_DISCOVERY_RANGE=LOCALHOST" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Build 
```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
sudo apt update
cd ~/mbot_ws
rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO --skip-keys=libcamera
colcon build --symlink-install
echo "source $PWD/install/local_setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source install/local_setup.bash
```
By default this will create the following directories as peers of the `src` directory:
- The `build` directory will be where intermediate files are stored. For each package a subfolder will be created in which e.g. CMake is being invoked.
- The `install` directory is where each package will be installed to. By default each package will be installed into a separate subdirectory.
- The `log` directory contains various logging information about each colcon invocation.

## Launch
### Bring up the mbot
```bash
ros2 launch mbot_bringup mbot_bringup.launch.py 
```
- This will bring up the lidar driver, the robot description for visualization, and the tf tree.
- **This command will not launch rviz.**

### Visualize the robot model
```bash
ros2 launch mbot_bringup mbot_bringup.launch.py 
```
Run the following line **on NoMachine**:
```bash
ros2 launch mbot_bringup mbot_viz.launch.py
```

### SLAM and Navigation
Please check the README file under mbot_navigation.

### Computer Vision
Please check the README file under mbot_vision.

## Individual packages
